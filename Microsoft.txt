Microsoft is a great place in a lot of ways,

1. Personal offices, helps a lot with productivity and working with focus.
2. Beautiful Campus, with lots of things to do.
3. Provides very good work life balance.
4. You will mostly find 3-5 people from your past acuaintances and friends working here.


It is not such a great place in a lot of ways too

1. Very few teams are actually doing really good work. A lot of it is just
   regular stuff.
2. Toxic culture, only the loudest mouth is rewarded, for some reasons PMs are
   rewarded way too unfairly for very little contribution. 
3. Most Dev leads know jackshit about management.
4. With the new bi-annual release cycle as an engineer I am only producing new
   work like 4 months a year, other 8 months my hands are tied due to check-in 
   restrictions.
5. At least two of my managers like to run the team like a Football team,
   where there is a coach, the quarterback and the rest of the team.
