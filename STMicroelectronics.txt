STMicroelectronics was a great place in some ways,

1. Work Life balance was the first priority for everybody.
2. Everybody was slow and lazy so there was a lot of room to outshine
   everybody without doing much. I missed to see this at the time.
3. There was a lot of shitty stuff around, I could have improved a lot
   of this and become a hero, but I missed this opportunity too.


NOT such a great place in some ways,

1. Too much inertia and unwillingness to adopt changes and the new. They had
   the first dual core chipset solution and still did not capitalize on it.
2. They stuck with Nokia even though Nokia adopted Windows and by extension
   Microsoft and Microsoft wanted nothing to do with STMicro, they only wanted to
   deal with Qualcomm. Emotional decisions I think, clinging to past
   relationships.
3. Absolutely no investment into buying the right tools, again I could have
   used this an opportunity to be a hero by setting up tools for the team.
